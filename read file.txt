"In this practice project, I will build a back-end utilizing Express and node.js. I will specify Express as app variable, but I will not use controllers or routes yet. The port it will be listening on is 3000. I will use the basic crud commands of get with specified urls so users can navigate to different pages of the site via a get command that gives a response of HTML code. This is very basic and very different compared to a react application or full stack or I mean a modern full stack that utilizes react router or folder structure as routes, but nevertheless, it will do for practice."
